# .hack();
**24 hr hackathon| IEEE MACE SB**


**.hack ();** is an idea to bring together experienced, intelligent individuals
from cross-functional teams to work together in an open environment
without any pressure of success or failure, to promote innovation and open
a new door of perspective for growth. We hope to provide you an
opportunity that can help to bridge the gap between the students and the
industry which in turn helps students find the career that they aspire.
